# Plugins Directory

This directory contains files that are automatically loaded by Nuxt. You can use `.server` or `.client` suffix in the file name to load a plugin only on the server or client side.

> All plugins in your `plugins/` directory are auto-registered, so you should not add them to your `nuxt.config` separately.
